// HAd a timer on each question, each question was worth 100 points, each second would eliminate a question,, and worth less points.
//make modular with dom loading a new one each time
// 1. get the right question to advance the game to the next question
// 1a. Get the right set of answers to display as lis
// 2. create a point counter that has the right question advance the point counter
// 3. have wrong questions lower the point counter
// 4. create a shuffle mechanism that re orders the questions
// 4. create a shuffle mechanism  that re orders the respective answers

// 5. add function that ends game at a certain negative point threshold
//6. add styling
//7. add intro that sets up the game
//8. add descending point values for the timer going down
