            <p>The year: 1601. The place: London, England. You awake one morning to find Shakespeare himself standing over your bed. 'Wake up!' he cries. 'There doth be no time to lose!'. He hurries you out the door, talking quickly. 'You hath been chosen to compete in a Shakespearean (that's me) Insult-Off. What's that, say you? Tis' a duel filled with rapscallions, rogues, and other roughians who wish to crush ye spirits and belittle ye hopes. But fear not! With a little knowledge of the Bard (that's me), ye will prevail! Or be humiliated. One of the two.' He shoves you through a door and you find yourself on stage at the Globe Theater, a crowd already waiting to challenge you.</p><p style="font-weight: bold"> Do you have what it takes?</p>
